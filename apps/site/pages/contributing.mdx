# Contributing

To contribute, clone the [`react-bluesky-embed` repository](https://github.com/hichemfantar/react-bluesky-embed) and run the [Next.js test app](/react/next#running-the-test-app) to start an app locally that uses the [`react-bluesky-embed` package](https://github.com/hichemfantar/react-bluesky-embed/blob/main/packages/react-bluesky-embed). Any changes you make to the package will be reflected in the test app.

Once you're done making changes, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/hichemfantar/react-bluesky-embed/compare).

It's recommended to [open an issue](https://github.com/hichemfantar/react-bluesky-embed/issues/new) first before making any major changes to the package so that we can discuss the changes before you start working on them.
