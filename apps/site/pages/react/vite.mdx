# Vite

## Installation

Follow the [installation docs in the Introduction](/#installation).

## Usage

In any component, import `PostThread` from `react-bluesky-embed` and use it like so:

```tsx
import { PostThread } from "react-bluesky-embed";

export const IndexPage = () => (
  <PostThread
    params={{
      did: "did:plc:gru662w3omynujkgwebgeeof",
      rkey: "3lbirib5xnc2u",
    }}
  />
);
```

You can learn more about `PostThread` in the [Bluesky theme docs](/bluesky-theme).

## Running the test app

Clone the [`react-bluesky-embed`](https://github.com/hichemfantar/react-bluesky-embed) repository and then run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm dev --filter=vite-app...
```

The app will be up and running at http://localhost:5173 for the [Vite app example](https://github.com/hichemfantar/react-bluesky-embed/tree/main/apps/vite-app).

The app shows the usage of `react-bluesky-embed` in different scenarios:

- [localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173) renders a single postThread.
- [localhost:5173/postThread/did:plc:y4zs4cabaezzwx3bz2e5nnj2/3lc3gazwx5s2m](http://localhost:5173/postThread/did:plc:y4zs4cabaezzwx3bz2e5nnj2/3lc3gazwx5s2m) renders dynamic post threads with SWR. `PostThread` already uses SWR and this page shows how to implement it manually.

The source code for `react-bluesky-embed` is imported from [packages/react-bluesky-embed](https://github.com/hichemfantar/react-bluesky-embed/tree/main/packages/react-bluesky-embed) and any changes you make to it will be reflected in the app immediately.
